/** \brief Interface for implementing dynamical systems. Other dynamical systems
 * should inherit from this class.
 *
 * See also the \ref page_dyn_sys page
 *
 * Two pure virtual functions that each DynamicalSystem subclass should
 * implement are \li differentialEquation() : The differential equation that
 * defines the system \li analyticalSolution() : The analytical solution to the
 * system at given times
 *
 * This class provides accesor/mutator methods for some variables typically
 * found in dynamical systems: \li dim() The dimensionality of the system, i.e.
 * the number of variables in the state vector. \li tau() The time constant of
 * the system \li initial_state() The initial state of the system \li
 * attractor_state() The attractor state, i.e. the state to which the system
 * will converge
 *
 * This class also provides functionality for integrating a dynamical system by
 * repeatidly calling it's differentialEquation, and doing simple Euler or
 * 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration. The related functions are: \li
 * set_integration_method(IntegrationMethod), i.e. EULER or RUNGE_KUTTA \li
 * integrateStep() Integrate the system one time step, using the current
 * integration method \li integrateStart() Start integrating the system (does
 * not require the current state to be passed)

/** \page page_dyn_sys Dynamical Systems

This page provides an  overview of the implementation of dynamical systems in
the \c dynamicalsystems/ module.

It is assumed you have read about the theory behind dynamical systems in the
tutorial <a
href="https://github.com/stulp/dmpbbo/blob/master/tutorial/dynamicalsystems.md">tutorial/dynamicalsystems.md</a>.

\section sec_dyn_sys_analytical_solution Analytical solution of a dynamical
system

In the object-oriented implementation of this module, all dynamical systems
inherit from the abstract DynamicalSystem class. The analytical solution of a
dynamical system is computed with DynamicalSystem::analyticalSolution, which
takes the times \c ts at which the solution should be computed, and returns the
evolution of the system as \c xs and \c xds.

\section sec_dyn_sys_numeric_integration Numeric integration of a dynamical
system

A system's differential equation is implement in the function
DynamicalSystem::differentialEquation, which takes the current state \c x, and
computes the rates of change \c xd. The functions
DynamicalSystem::integrateStart() and DynamicalSystem::integrateStep() are then
used to numerically integrate the system as follows (using the example plotted
above):

\code
// Make exponential system that decays from 4 to 0 with decay constant 6, and
tau=1.0 double alpha = 6.0;                // Decay constant double tau = 1.0;
// Time constant VectorXd x_init(1); x_init << 4.0; // Initial state (a 1D
vector with the value 4.0 inside using Eigen comma initializer) VectorXd
x_attr(1); x_attr << 0.0; // Attractor state DynamicalSystem* dyn_sys = new
ExponentialSystem(tau, x_init, x_attr, alpha);

Eigen::VectorXd x, xd;
dyn_sys->integrateStart(x,xd); // Start the integration
double dt = 0.01;
for (double t=0.0; t<1.5; t+=dt)
{
  dyn_sys->integrateStep(dt,x,x,xd);          // Takes current state x,
integrates system, and writes next state in x, xd cout << t << " " << x << " "
<< xd << endl; // Output current time, state and rate of change
}
delete dyn_sys;
\endcode

\em Remark. Both analyticalSolution and differentialEquation functions above are
const, i.e. they do not change the DynamicalSystem itself.

\em Remark. DynamicalSystem::integrateStep() uses either Euler integration, or
4-th order Runge-Kutta.  Runge-Kutta is much more accurate, but requires 4 calls
of DynamicalSystem::differentialEquation() instead of only 1 for Euler
integration. Which one is used can be set with
DynamicalSystem::set_integration_method(). To numerically integrate a dynamical
system, one must carefully choose the integration time dt. Choosing it too low
leads to inaccurate integration, and the numerical integration will diverge from
the "true" solution acquired through analytical solution. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_method for examples. Choosing dt depends
entirely on the time-scale (seconds vs. years) and parameters of the dynamical
system (time constant, decay parameters).


\section dyn_sys_rewrite_second_first Rewriting one 2nd Order Systems as two 1st
Order Systems

For the theory, behind this see
<a
href="../../../tutorial/dynamicalsystems.md#dyn_sys_second_order_systems">tutorial/dynamicalsystems.md</a>.

The constructor DynamicalSystem::DynamicalSystem() immediately converts second
order systems, such as SpringDamperSystem, into first order systems with an
expanded state.

The function DynamicalSystem::dim() returns the size of the entire state vector
\f$ \mathbf{x} = [y~z]\f$, the function DynamicalSystem::dim_orig() return the
size of only the \f$ y \f$ component. The attractor and initial stateof the
dynamical system must always have the size returned by
DynamicalSystem::dim_orig().
