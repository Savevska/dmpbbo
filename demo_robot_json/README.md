Please see the README of `demo_robot`, which applies here also.

This is a basic working version of reading/writing with json instead of xml, implemented to check compatibility between the two. 

Due to using json, several steps have been simplified in comparison to `demo_robot`, which uses xml.

In v2.0 of dmpbbo, the XML will be removed, and the demo in this directory will be further improved (I suggest to wait until v2.0 before using this demo as a basis for your work).
